## Intro

Who does not know what a Higher Order Component is?

## Me

End of slide: Who knows the difference between a React Node, Element and Component?

## Higher order components:

Everything is a function

WHo is using redux
Keep up
Who is using higher order components


## ACD

## Example 
creates tight coupling, use higher order component to make sure the prop is available and provide if its not

redux-simple-router formerly known as react-router, not to be confused with react-router-redux, which, in my opinion, is the best option today

## Render performance

Pure Render mixing


## Drawbacks

1. HOC not everyoneâ€™s cup of tea, might take some time to get into and leverage concepts like currying
2. Since code should be re-used you need to consider more places to understand a certain feature
    1. Thus its possible to write conflicting modifications, so use sparingly
3. New components introduced to the tree / Can be addressed leveraging pure render from recompose

## Benefits

1. Keep your render functions small, go the linux and node approach to create little reusable modules that do one thing and do it well
2. Stateless function components prevent abuse of state and are easier to optimize for React and V8 
3. Important to keep in mind as your application is growing
4. Save lines in render, merge service functionality into components from single place
5. Decorators might still be a stage 0 proposal, but they offer a very declarative way of extending your components
